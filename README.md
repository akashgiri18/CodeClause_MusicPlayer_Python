# CodeClause_MusicPlayer_Python
This is a simple music player application built using the Tkinter and Pygame library in Python. It allows users to load a folder of MP3 files, create a playlist, and control playback of the songs. The application provides buttons for playing, pausing, skipping to the next or previous song, and a listbox to display the songs in the playlist.
